# Available Evaluation Models

The two main COMET models are:

- **Default model:** [`Unbabel/wmt22-comet-da`](https://huggingface.co/Unbabel/wmt22-comet-da) - This model uses a reference-based regression approach and is built on top of XLM-R. It has been trained on direct assessments from WMT17 to WMT20 and provides scores ranging from 0 to 1, where 1 represents a perfect translation.
- **Upcoming model:** [`Unbabel/wmt22-cometkiwi-da`](https://huggingface.co/Unbabel/wmt22-cometkiwi-da) - This reference-free model uses a regression approach and is built on top of InfoXLM. It has been trained on direct assessments from WMT17 to WMT20, as well as direct assessments from the MLQE-PE corpus. Like the default model, it also provides scores ranging from 0 to 1.

These two models were part of the final ensemble used in our WMT22 [Metrics](https://aclanthology.org/2022.wmt-1.52/) and [QE](https://aclanthology.org/2022.wmt-1.60/) shared tasks. 

For versions prior to 2.0, you can still use [`Unbabel/wmt20-comet-da`](https://huggingface.co/Unbabel/wmt20-comet-da), which is the primary metric, and Unbabel/[`Unbabel/wmt20-comet-qe-da`](https://huggingface.co/Unbabel/wmt20-comet-qe-da) for the respective reference-free version.
